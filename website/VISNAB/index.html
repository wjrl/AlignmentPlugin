<p>
The Visualization of Network Alignments using BioFabric (VISNAB) plugin is a software tool that is designed to give network researchers the ability to usefully visualize
the results of a network alignment, even for very large networks. VISNAB provides the user with new insights into network alignment deficiencies that are 
not revealed through the simple evaluation and comparison of the standard numerical topological measures. 
</p>
Significant features for VISNAB:
<ul>
<li>
Node groups and link groups provide a flexible method to characterize an alignment's topology. With BioFabric V2, node and link group annotations clearly highlight the different groups.
</li>
<li>
The Group Layout allows users to visually assess common topological measures such as Edge Coverage (EC), Symmetric Substructure Score (S3), and Induced Conserved Structure (ICS).
</li>
<li>
The Cycle Layout allows users to find small and large scale misalignments when the perfect alignment is provided.
</li>
<li>
Our novel measures Jaccard Similarity (JS), Node Group Similarity (NGS), and Link Group Similarity (LGS) provide advantages over traditional methods, such as Node Correctness (NC), when comparing a generated alignment to the perfect alignment.
</li>
<li>
BioFabric provides the values of many common alignment measures, including EC, S3, ICS, and NC. It also includes our JS, NGS, and LGS.
</li>
<li>
 Visually asses objective functions' performance on a pair of networks: BioFabric lets the user <i> see </i> how single measures and combinations of measures within objective functions affect the generated alignment's topology.
</li>
<li>
 Lay correctly and incorrectly aligned nodes separately in the Group Layout. The user can choose the criterion for the correct alignment to be either Node Correctness or Jaccard Similarity (user can set the threshold value).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Download and Installation</h3>

<h4>Preparations</h4>
<p>
VISNAB is written as a BioFabric plugin, and requires that your first install <b>BioFabric Version 2 Beta Release 2</b> (or higher). 
Note that the current production Version 1.0 of BioFabric is <i>not designed</i> to support plugins; <b>Version 2 Beta Release 2 or higher is required</b>. 
BioFabric is written in Java, and can be run on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. Starting with Version 2 Beta Release 2, the Java runtime 
(OpenJDK 12) is <i>bundled with</i> BioFabric on all platforms, so a separate Java download is no longer required.
</p>
<p>
BioFabric Version 2 Beta Release 2 is currently available either as a zip file for Windows (named <code>BioFabric20B2.zip</code>),
as a mountable disk image for Mac (named <code>BioFabricInstallImageV2BetaRel2.dmg</code>), or as a tgz file for Linux (named <code>BioFabric-2.0.B.2.tgz</code>).
These are all available from the <a href="https://github.com/wjrl/BioFabric/releases/tag/V2.0Beta2">BioFabric GitHub repository release page</a>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Windows:</b> Unzip the <code>BioFabric20B2.zip</code> file as a folder on your desktop. Go into the folder. If you want to install 
BioFabric in the Windows <b>Program Files</b> folder, you will need to run the BioFabricInstaller as an Admin user. To do that, 
right-click on the BioFabricInstaller program and choose <b>Run as administrator</b>. If you are not an Admin, you will need to 
install it somewhere within your home directory by changing the install location as part of the installation. Once the installation is 
complete, you can right-click on the BioFabric program and select <b>Create shortcut</b>, then e.g. drag it to your desktop.
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>Mac:</b> Double-click the downloaded <code>BioFabricInstallImageV2BetaRel2.dmg</code> disk image file to mount it, and then 
open a Finder window for the mounted disk. From the Finder window, drag the BioFabric icon inside onto your desktop (or, if you prefer, 
into your Applications folder).If <b>Mac Gatekeeper</b> has been set to restrict to only <b>App Store</b>, you will need to 
launch <b>System Preferences</b>, click on <b>Security & Privacy</b>, and on the <b>General</b> tab set <b>Allow apps downloaded 
from: App Store and identified developers</b>. If you take this step, you probably want to reset it back to <b>App Store</b> 
after starting BioFabric the first time. 
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>Linux:</b> Untar the <code>BioFabric-2.0.B.2.tgz</code> file (<code>tar xvzf BioFabric-2.0.B.2.tgz</code>). The shell script
to run the program is <code>BioFabric/BioFabricV2BetaRel2.sh</code>.
</li><br/>
</ul>

<h4>Installing the Plugin</h4>
The <b>VISNAB</b> plugin is a Java JAR file. This compiled JAR file is available on the 
<a href="https://github.com/wjrl/AlignmentPlugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0.0">VISNAB GitHub repository release page</a>. To install it, download the 
<code>sVISNAB-V1.1.0.0.jar</code> file, then simply drop that file into a directory on your computer. (Note that there should be only one copy of the
VISNAB JAR file in that directory.) Start BioFabric, and use <b>File->Set Plugin Directory...</b> to point to the <i>directory</i> where you have placed 
<code>sVISNAB-V1.1.0.0.jar</code>. Restart BioFabric, and the VISNAB commands will appear in the <b>Tools->Network Alignment</b> menu.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
More complete documentation is being prepared. 
</p>
<p>
To get started, once the plugin has been installed, VISNAB commands can be run from the main <b>Tools->Network Alignment</b> menu. VISNAB supports both SIF 
and LEDA (GW) graph file formats, and the ALIGN file format for alignment files. The graphs must be undirected. 
</p>
<p>
Available commands include:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Edge Group Layout...</b> will use the Default Node and Link Group Layout algorithm. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Orphan Edge Layout...</b> will show only the Blue edges and the edges of nodes present in the Blue link group.
</li>
<li>
<b>Alignment Cycle layout...</b> will highlight misalignments of clusters and cliques.
</li>
<li>
<b>Alignment Measures...</b> will show common measures once an alignment has been loaded.
</li>
</ul>
