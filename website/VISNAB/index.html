<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The Visualization of Network Alignments using BioFabric (VISNAB) plugin is a software tool that is designed to give network researchers the ability to usefully visualize
the results of a network alignment, even for very large networks. VISNAB provides the user with new insights into network alignment deficiencies that are 
not revealed through the simple evaluation and comparison of the standard numerical topological measures. 
</p>
Significant features for VISNAB:
<ul>
<li>
Node groups and link groups provide a flexible method to characterize an alignment's topology. With BioFabric V2, node and link group annotations clearly highlight the different groups.
</li>
<li>
The Group Layout allows users to visually assess common topological measures such as Edge Coverage (EC), Symmetric Substructure Score (S3), and Induced Conserved Structure (ICS).
</li>
<li>
The Cycle Layout allows users to find small and large scale misalignments when the perfect alignment is provided.
</li>
<li>
Our novel measures Jaccard Similarity (JS), Node Group Similarity (NGS), and Link Group Similarity (LGS) provide advantages over traditional methods, such as Node Correctness (NC), when comparing a generated alignment to the perfect alignment.
</li>
<li>
BioFabric provides the values of many common alignment measures, including EC, S3, ICS, and NC. It also includes our JS, NGS, and LGS.
</li>
<li>
 Visually asses objective functions' performance on a pair of networks: BioFabric lets the user <i> see </i> how single measures and combinations of measures within objective functions affect the generated alignment's topology.
</li>
<li>
 Lay correctly and incorrectly aligned nodes separately in the Group Layout. The user can choose the criterion for the correct alignment to be either Node Correctness or Jaccard Similarity (user can set the threshold value).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Download and Installation</h3>

<h4>Preparations</h4>
<p>
VISNAB is written as a BioFabric plugin, and requires that your first install BioFabric Version 2 (Beta), which is currently under development. 
Note that the current production Version 1.0 of BioFabric is not designed to support plugins; <b>Version 2 is required</b>. BioFabric is written in Java, 
and can be run on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. For Windows, you will first need to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.java.com/">here</a> (click the "Free Java Download" button). For the Mac, the executable already contains the JRE.
</p>
<p>
BioFabric Version 2 (Beta) is currently available either as a zip file for Windows (named <code>BioFabric20B1.zip</code>) or as a mountable disk image 
for Macs (named <code>BioFabricInstallImageV2BetaRel1.dmg</code>). These are both available from the 
<a href="https://github.com/wjrl/BioFabric/releases/tag/V2.0Beta1a">BioFabric GitHub repository release page</a>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Windows:</b> Unzip the <code>BioFabric20B1.zip</code> file and drag the <code>BioFabric.exe</code> file out of the archive and 
drop it on your desktop. Double-clicking on the desktop 
icon will start the program running. On Windows, you will probably need to agree to run software from an unknown publisher, or read a 
message that "Windows protected your PC", that the app is unrecognized, and you will need to click on the <b>More info</b> link to be able to choose
the option to <b>Run Anyway</b>. (Note: The executable file <i>has been signed</i>, but the signing certificate has currently expired.) 
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>Mac:</b> Double-click the downloaded <code>BioFabricInstallImageV2BetaRel1.dmg</code> disk image file to mount it, and then 
open a Finder window for the mounted disk. From the Finder window, 
drag the BioFabric icon inside onto your desktop (or, if you prefer, into your Applications folder). Both the disk image and the BioFabric program 
itself have been signed. However, if <b>Mac Gatekeeper</b> has been set to restrict to only <b>App Store</b>, you will need to launch <b>System Preferences</b>, 
click on <b>Security & Privacy</b>, and on the <b>General</b> tab set <b>Allow apps downloaded from: App Store and identified developers</b>. 
If you take this step, you may wish to reset it back to <b>App Store</b> after starting BioFabric the first time. 
</li><br/>
</ul>

<h4>Installing the Plugin</h4>
The <b>VISNAB</b> plugin is a Java JAR file. This compiled JAR file is available on the 
<a href="https://github.com/wjrl/AlignmentPlugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0.1">VISNAB GitHub repository release page</a>. To install it, download the 
<code>sVISNAB-V1.0.0.1.jar</code> file, then simply drop that file into a directory on your computer. (Note that there should be only one copy of the
VISNAB JAR file in that directory.) Start BioFabric, and use <b>File->Set Plugin Directory...</b> to point to the <i>directory</i> where you have placed 
<code>sVISNAB-V1.0.0.1.jar</code>. Restart BioFabric, and the VISNAB commands will appear in the <b>Tools->Network Alignment</b> menu.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
More complete documentation is being prepared. 
</p>
<p>
To get started, once the plugin has been installed, VISNAB commands can be run from the main <b>Tools->Network Alignment</b> menu. VISNAB supports both SIF 
and LEDA (GW) graph file formats, and the ALIGN file format for alignment files. The graphs must be undirected. 
</p>
<p>
Available commands include:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Edge Group Layout...</b> will use the Default Node and Link Group Layout algorithm. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Orphan Edge Layout...</b> will show only the Blue edges and the edges of nodes present in the Blue link group.
</li>
<li>
<b>Alignment Cycle layout...</b> will highlight misalignments of clusters and cliques.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Alignment Measures...</b> will show common measures once an alignment has been loaded.
</li>
</ul>
